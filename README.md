# N-BaIoT-ExplainableAI

The N-BaIoT (Network-Based Anomaly IoT) is a dataset designed for anomaly detection and classification in Internet of Things (IoT) networks. It is commonly used to identify malicious network traffic on IoT devices and to study machine learning techniques and security analysis in networks.  

This script utilizes the SHAP library in conjunction with the XGBoost classification algorithm to process data from the dataset. It computes performance metrics and generates various types of explainability graphs. Additionally, the script tool.py consolidates all dataset files into a single file and labels the rows with one of three classes: mirai, gafgyt, or benign.
